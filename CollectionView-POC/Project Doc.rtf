\f0\fs24 \cf0 To Do:\
- Source control entire project - done\
- Create folder structure for Model group - done\
- Move ImageLoadManager to Model group/folder - done\
- Create Constants file and move all constants and #Defines - in progress (Constants class created)\
- Create VC with table view and connect to Cafe segment - done\
- Implement table view from above VC to display location based coffee shops - in progress\
- Remove footerview and FooterViewCell class once buttons are successfully added to collectionview cell - not started\
- Make sure segmented control is lined up evenly with search bar above\
\
Problems:\
1. Still not able to get button/label displayed under each cell. Unsure if supplemental view can be used, still researching. Other option is to increase cell size and fit everything inside - not my preference\
2. Added button with heart image to full screen image. Tapping button does not respond. May be a frame bounds issue with the button and the parent view.\
\
Bugs:\
1. When tapping the Cafes in the segment control and going to the next VC and then hitting back button, the segment control retains Cafes as highlighted segment. \
Need to change this to make it go back to Images. Fixed, but may need to resolve with a delegate\
2. When viewing full screen image, tapping in upper right area will cause segue to cafe locator VC. Fixed by setting the segmentedcontrol.hidden=YES}
