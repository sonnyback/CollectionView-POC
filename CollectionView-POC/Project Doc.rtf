\f0\fs24 \cf0 To Do:\
- Source control entire project - done\
- Create folder structure for Model group - Done\
- Move ImageLoadManager to Model group/folder - Done\
- Create Constants file and move all constants and #Defines - in progress (Constants class created, refer to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/538996/constants-in-objective-c"}}{\fldrslt http://stackoverflow.com/questions/538996/constants-in-objective-c}})\
- Create VC with table view and connect to Cafe segment - Done\
- Implement table view from above VC to display location based coffee shops (copy example from MapSearch sample project) - in progress\
- Remove footerview and FooterViewCell class once buttons are successfully added to collectionview cell - changed layout, footers no longer needed and have been removed - Done\
- Make sure segmented control is lined up evenly with search bar above (probably need to adjust constraints)  - reference this link {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-interface_builder/articles-autolayout/align-constraints.html"}}{\fldrslt https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-interface_builder/articles-autolayout/align-constraints.html}}\
- Need to map CoffeeImageData.isLiked to cell image AND be able to map it when someone taps the like button to update and set it in the model. - Done\
- ****Need to resolve issue of like button not changing on demand when clicking - reference Matchismo. This may be related to control state for the button. \
- Need to look into SDWebImage (what exactly is it and should I use it for loading web images and caching) - {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15706154/memory-management-many-images-in-uicollectionview"}}{\fldrslt http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15706154/memory-management-many-images-in-uicollectionview}}\
\
Problems:\
1. Still not able to get button/label displayed under each cell. Unsure if supplemental view can be used, still researching. Other option is to increase cell size and fit everything inside - not my preference\
2. Added button with heart image to full screen image. Tapping button does not respond. May be a frame bounds issue with the button and the parent view.\
\
Bugs:\
1. When tapping the Cafes in the segment control and going to the next VC and then hitting back button, the segment control retains Cafes as highlighted segment. \
Need to change this to make it go back to Images. *Fixed*, but may need to resolve with a delegate after further development of app\
2. When viewing full screen image, tapping in upper right area will cause segue to cafe locator VC. *Fixed* by setting the segmentedcontrol.hidden=YES\
3. When liking an image, then tapping to close the image, then going back into the image in fullscreen, the solid like button is not visible. *Fixed* - issue was related to control state for the button \
4. Heart image displays correctly when liking/unliking by tapping the heart button. But if an image is liked, then you go back to the collectionview and then back to the image that is liked, unliking does not show the correct heart image. *Fixed*\
5. Logic not right inside likeButtonPressed regarding currentImageData.imageName. This is coming up as null. }
